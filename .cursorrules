# Counter-Terrorism Website - .cursorrules

## Project Intelligence & Patterns

### Critical Project Context
This is a Russian-language educational website about terrorism prevention ("Терроризму НЕТ"). The project serves as a public service resource with government-appropriate professional design. All development must maintain the serious, trustworthy nature while being accessible and user-friendly.

### Key Technical Patterns

#### Mobile Menu Architecture
**Critical Pattern**: The mobile menu uses a full-screen overlay with transparent background and blur effect:
- Background: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.65)` with `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`
- Button styling: Consistent `rgba(183, 28, 28, 0.7)` for all menu items
- **MUST preserve scroll position**: Store `window.scrollY` before menu operations, restore after closing
- Theme-aware text colors: Black for light theme, white for dark theme

#### Theme System Implementation
**Pattern**: CSS custom properties for complete theming:
- Root variables define light theme defaults
- `[data-theme="dark"]` overrides for dark theme
- **All components must support both themes** - no exceptions
- localStorage persistence with fallback to 'light'
- 0.5s transition timing for smooth theme changes

#### Emergency Services Integration
**Critical UX Pattern**: Floating emergency button (112) appears ONLY on homepage:
- Auto-expand on page load, auto-collapse after 2 seconds
- One-click copy to clipboard with tooltip feedback
- Must maintain professional appearance - this is emergency contact

### Development Workflow Preferences

#### CSS Organization
**Strict Pattern**: Follow established CSS architecture:
1. CSS Variables (theming)
2. Base styles and resets
3. Component styles
4. Responsive media queries
5. Animation definitions

#### JavaScript Structure
**Pattern**: Everything inside DOMContentLoaded wrapper:
1. Feature detection first
2. Theme management
3. Navigation handling
4. Emergency button functionality
5. Event listeners last
6. Utility functions outside wrapper

#### Responsive Breakpoints
**Standard Set**: 480px, 576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px
- Mobile-first approach always
- Test at 768px breakpoint (mobile menu transition)
- Ensure touch targets are minimum 44px

### Critical User Experience Rules

#### Scroll Position Management
**NEVER allow scroll position to be lost during navigation**:
- Mobile menu operations must preserve position
- Hash link navigation should be smooth
- Current page links should not trigger scroll-to-top

#### Emergency Access Priority
**112 emergency number must always be accessible**:
- Floating button on homepage
- Phone number in footer on all pages
- FSB hotline in footer: 8 (495) 224-22-22
- Copy functionality must work reliably

#### Professional Appearance Standards
**Government-appropriate design requirements**:
- Red color scheme: `#b71c1c` / `rgba(183, 28, 28, 0.7)`
- No flashy animations or distracting elements
- Content must be educational, not fear-inducing
- Maintain authority through clean, professional design

### Browser Compatibility Patterns

#### Backdrop Filter Handling
**Pattern for modern effects with fallbacks**:
```css
backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(8px);

/* Firefox fallback */
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
    background-color: var(--header-bg);
    opacity: 0.95;
}
```

#### Cross-Browser Testing Priority
1. Chrome/Chromium (primary target)
2. Safari (webkit prefixes critical)
3. Firefox (backdrop-filter fallbacks needed)
4. Mobile browsers (primary use case)

### Content and Language Guidelines

#### Russian Language Context
- Primary language is Russian - respect Cyrillic encoding
- Cultural context: Serious government service website
- Terminology: Use formal, official language for safety content
- Emergency services: Always include 112 (universal emergency)

#### Content Hierarchy
1. Emergency contact information (highest priority)
2. Basic terrorism recognition information
3. Safety guidelines (памятка)
4. Historical context and additional resources
5. Organizational information

### Performance and Optimization Rules

#### Critical Performance Patterns
- System fonts only (no web font loading delay)
- CSS custom properties for efficient theming
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- WebP images where supported

#### Mobile Performance Priority
**Mobile-first performance optimization**:
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Fast menu animations (0.3s max)
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Minimal layout thrashing

### Git and Version Control Patterns

#### Branch Management
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `version-X.Y`: Stable release branches  
- Feature branches for specific improvements
- Mobile improvements: Test thoroughly before merge

#### Commit Message Style
- English commit messages for clarity
- Descriptive commits for mobile UX changes
- Reference issue types: "Fix mobile menu scroll position"

### Development Environment Notes

#### Windows PowerShell Considerations
- Cyrillic encoding configured for git
- Use `chcp 65001` for UTF-8 console
- Python http.server for local development testing

#### Testing Protocol
**Essential testing checklist**:
1. Mobile menu functionality across devices
2. Theme switching in all browsers
3. Emergency button behavior
4. Scroll position preservation
5. Cross-browser compatibility (especially Firefox)

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Mobile Menu Debug Pattern
If mobile menu issues arise:
1. Check `z-index` hierarchy (menu-toggle: 1500, nav: 1200)
2. Verify `overflow: hidden` on body when menu open
3. Confirm scroll position storage/restore logic
4. Test backdrop-filter fallbacks

#### Theme Integration Debugging
For theme-related issues:
1. Verify CSS custom property inheritance
2. Check localStorage persistence
3. Confirm both light/dark state handling
4. Test transition animations

This project represents a successful implementation of modern web standards for a serious public service website. Maintain the balance between modern UX and professional government-appropriate design.
