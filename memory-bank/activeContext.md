## Current State Overview
**Project Status**: Version 1.5+ - Mobile Menu Critical Fix Complete ✅
**Last Major Update**: Fixed critical mobile menu disappearing bug + enhanced styling
**Current Branch**: `version-1.5`
**Repository**: https://github.com/theJorDea/Countering-terrorism-website.git

## Recent Critical Fix (Current Session) ⚠️➡️✅

### Mobile Menu Critical Bug Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Critical Problem**: Mobile menu was instantly disappearing when clicked but not properly closing
**Root Cause**: CSS `display: none !important` conflicted with JavaScript state management
**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced `display: none` with `opacity: 0` and `visibility: hidden`
- Added smooth `translateY` transforms for better animations
- Improved JavaScript logic with proper state management
- Enhanced accessibility with keyboard navigation and focus management

### Technical Improvements Made:

1. **CSS Architecture Fix**:
   - **From**: `display: none !important` (problematic)
   - **To**: `opacity: 0` + `visibility: hidden` + `transform: translateY(-100%)`
   - **Result**: Smooth transitions without DOM manipulation issues

2. **Enhanced Styling**:
   - Larger touch targets (85% width, max 320px)
   - Better spacing (18px padding, 10px margins)
   - Improved shadows and hover effects
   - More modern border-radius (12px)
   - Enhanced button hover animations with `translateY(-2px)`

3. **JavaScript Refactoring**:
   - Centralized `closeMenu()` function for consistent behavior
   - Better scroll position management with `savedScrollPosition` variable
   - Added keyboard navigation (Escape key closes menu)
   - Improved accessibility with focus management
   - Window resize handler to close menu on desktop

4. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Added Firefox fallback for backdrop-filter
   - Improved cross-browser CSS compatibility
   - Better webkit prefix handling

## Active Development Considerations

### Why This Fix Was Critical
**User Impact**: Menu completely unusable on mobile (primary target platform)
**Technical Issue**: CSS `display: none` prevented proper JavaScript state management
**Solution Strategy**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for smoother, more reliable behavior

### Design Improvements Made
- **Enhanced shadows**: `0 2px 8px` normal, `0 4px 12px` on hover
- **Better borders**: 2px transparent borders with white highlight on hover
- **Improved spacing**: 18px padding, 12px border-radius for modern feel
- **Professional animations**: Subtle `translateY(-2px)` lift on hover

### Browser Compatibility Strategy
**Firefox backdrop-filter**: Added specific fallback with `rgba(30, 30, 30, 0.95)`
**Webkit prefixes**: Maintained for Safari compatibility
**Cross-browser testing**: Ensured consistent behavior across platforms

## Current Status: EXCELLENT ✅
